===== PM4PY 1.2.6 =====
This is a minor release, consisting of the following changes:

- Pyarrow serialization integration (supporting in-memory and to .pkl file serialization)
- bug fix in the 'escaping edges' based precision


===== PM4PY 1.2.7 =====
This is a minor release, consisting of the following changes:

- Bug fix (programming error) in the alignments code
- Changed recursion depth in token-based replay invisibles exploration
- Removed copy.copy for parent nodes of childs in log generation from process tree

- Bug fix process tree children setter
- Consider only fittin traces in the Align-ETConformance count
- Consider ALL the optimal alignments (as described in the paper) and not only the first one
- Refactoring: moving of utilities and making the search function using Dijkstra (since we are looking for fit paths) instead of A*
- LTL Checker updated:
    - Making existing filters more performant (A eventually B eventually C)
    - Introducing A eventually B eventually C eventually D
    - Introducing time boundaries for each arc of the eventualties
- drop windows platform reuquirement for ortools/pyarrow
