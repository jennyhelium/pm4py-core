Understanding Process Mining
---------------------------
In this section, we explain what process mining is all about. 
Note that, this page just describes the basics of process mining, i.e., it is not a full-fledged reference of every possible aspect of process mining. 
Therefore, for a more detailed overview of process mining, we recommend taking a look at the `Coursera MOOC on Process Mining <https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining>`_, and, the `seminal book of Wil van der Aalst <https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783662498507>`_. 
Furthermore, before you begin, please make sure to install PM4Py on your system, i.e., as described in the :doc:`install` section.

Processes in our Modern World
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The vast majority of companies active in virtually any domain executes a process. 
Whether the core business of a company is to deliver a product, e.g., manufacture a car, cooking a delicious pizza, etc., or, providing a service, e.g., providing you with a mortgage to buy your dream house, paying back your insurance claim, etc., for efficient delivery of your product/service, processes are executed. 
Hence, a natural question is: “What is a process?”. 
In general, several notions of the concept of a process exist. 
However, in process mining, we typically assume the following conceptual definition:

"A **process** represents a **collection of activities** that we **execute** to achieve a **certain goal**."
